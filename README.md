#Part 1: Introduction to Software Engineering

Explain what software engineering is and discuss its importance in the technology industry.
(A) Software engineering is a systematic application of engineering principle to desing, develop, testing and maintaing software system


Identify and describe at least three key milestones in the evolution of software engineering.
(A) 1 The Birth of Software Engineering (1968): the term 'Software Engineering' was first introduced at the NATO software Engineering conference to address the 'software crisis', where
      large-scale software projects were failing due to poor planning, inefficiency, and high cost.the milestone marked the shift from ad-hoc programming to structured development 
      methodologies.
      
    2 The Rise  of Object-Oriented Programming(1980s-1990s): The development of object-oriented programming(OOP), pioneered by languages like smalltalk and later popularized by C++ and 
      java, revolutionized software design. OOP improved code resusability, modularity,and maintainability, making software development more efficient and scalable.
      
    3 The Agile Revolution (2001 - Present): The indroduction of the Agile manifesto in 2001 transformed software developent by promoting iterative development, customer collaboration 
      and adaptability .

List and briefly explain the phases of the Software Development Life Cycle.
   (A) Phases of the Software Development Life Cycle (SDLC)
       1 Planning: This initial phase involves defining the project scope, objectives, and feasibility. Stakeholders analyze requirements, set timelines, and allocate resources to ensure 
         smooth development.

       2 Requirement Analysis: Developers and business analysts gather, document, and validate user and system requirements to ensure the software meets business needs and regulatory 
        standards.

      3 Design: System architects and designers create blueprints for the software, including architecture, user interfaces, databases, and system components, ensuring scalability and 
        efficiency.

      4 Implementation (Coding): Developers write the actual code based on the design specifications, following best practices and coding standards to build functional software modules.

      5 Testing: The software undergoes rigorous testing (unit, integration, system, and user acceptance testing) to identify and fix bugs, ensuring reliability and performance.

      6 Deployment: The tested software is released to users, either in a phased manner or as a full launch, ensuring a smooth transition with minimal disruptions.

      7 Maintenance & Support: After deployment, developers provide updates, bug fixes, and enhancements based on user feedback to ensure long-term performance and security.

Compare and contrast the Waterfall and Agile methodologies. Provide examples of scenarios where each would be appropriate.
(A) The Waterfall methodology follows a structured, sequential approach where each phase (planning, design, implementation, testing, deployment, and maintenance) must be completed before 
    moving to the next. It is best suited for projects with well-defined requirements, minimal expected changes, and strict regulatory compliance, such as government systems or banking 
    software. Since testing occurs at the end, any issues found late in the process can be costly and time-consuming to fix.

   In contrast, the Agile methodology is an iterative and flexible approach that emphasizes continuous development, testing, and customer collaboration. Agile breaks down projects into 
   small, manageable increments called sprints, allowing teams to adapt to changing requirements quickly. This makes it ideal for software projects like mobile applications and SaaS 
   products, where frequent updates and evolving user needs are expected.

   While Waterfall provides a clear roadmap and is beneficial for projects requiring strong documentation, Agile fosters innovation and adaptability, making it more suitable for dynamic 
   industries. Waterfall works best for projects with stable requirements, while Agile thrives in fast-paced environments where customer feedback drives development. Choosing between the 
   two depends on the project’s nature, complexity, and need for flexibility.

Describe the roles and responsibilities of a Software Developer, a Quality Assurance Engineer, and a Project Manager in a software engineering team.
(A) 1 A Software Developer is responsible for writing, testing, and maintaining code to build functional software applications based on project requirements.

    2 A Quality Assurance (QA) Engineer ensures software reliability by designing and executing test cases, identifying bugs, and verifying that the product meets quality standards 
      before release.

    3 A Project Manager oversees the software development process, managing timelines, resources, and communication among stakeholders to ensure successful project delivery.


Discuss the importance of Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) and Version Control Systems (VCS) in the software development process. Give examples of each.
(A) Integrated Development Environments (IDEs) streamline software development by providing tools like code editors, debuggers, and build automation in a unified interface, enhancing 
    productivity and reducing errors; examples include Visual Studio Code, IntelliJ IDEA, and Eclipse.

    Version Control Systems (VCS) enable developers to track changes, collaborate efficiently, and revert to previous versions if needed, ensuring code integrity and teamwork in software 
    projects; examples include Git, SVN (Subversion), and Mercurial.

What are some common challenges faced by software engineers? Provide strategies to overcome these challenges.
(A) Common challenges faced by software engineers include debugging complex code, managing changing requirements, handling tight deadlines, ensuring security, and collaborating in teams, 
    which can be overcome by using efficient debugging tools, adopting Agile methodologies, prioritizing tasks with time management techniques, implementing secure coding practices, and 
    utilizing collaboration tools like Git and Jira.

Explain the different types of testing (unit, integration, system, and acceptance) and their importance in software quality assurance.
(A) Unit testing verifies individual components or functions to ensure they work correctly in isolation, integration testing checks how different modules interact to detect communication 
    issues, system testing evaluates the complete application against functional and non-functional requirements, and acceptance testing validates whether the software meets business 
    needs and user expectations before deployment, all of which are crucial for ensuring software reliability, performance, and user satisfaction.

#Part 2: Introduction to AI and Prompt Engineering


Define prompt engineering and discuss its importance in interacting with AI models.
(A) Prompt engineering is the practice of designing and refining input queries to effectively communicate with AI models, ensuring accurate, relevant, and high-quality responses. It 
    involves structuring prompts in a way that optimizes the model’s understanding and output, often using techniques like contextual framing, role-based instructions, and examples. This 
    skill is crucial in AI applications, as it enhances efficiency, reduces ambiguity, and improves the reliability of AI-generated content. In fields like customer service, content 
    creation, and software development, prompt engineering helps users get precise and actionable responses, making AI tools more useful and adaptable to real-world applications.

Provide an example of a vague prompt and then improve it by making it clear, specific, and concise. Explain why the improved prompt is more effective.
(A) Vague Prompt: "Tell me about technology."

    Improved Prompt: "Explain the impact of artificial intelligence on software development, focusing on automation, code generation, and debugging."

    The improved prompt is more effective because it specifies the exact aspect of technology (artificial intelligence), the domain (software development), and key focus areas 
    (automation, code generation, and debugging). This clarity helps the AI generate a precise, relevant, and well-structured response, avoiding overly broad or generic information. A 
    well-defined prompt ensures efficiency, saves time, and enhances the usefulness of AI-generated content.
